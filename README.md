# Clustercon

Clustercon attempts to create an unconfigured environment for cluster computing
jobs, but in a way that brings compute node creation and network configuration
to the programmer as very quick first class operations.

Still very early days, but basic interface setup and container launch do work
with aufs and/or chroot.
