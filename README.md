This repository is an attempt at creating clean environment for cluster computing,
in a way that brings compute node creation and network configuration to the programmer
as very quick turnaround first class operations.

The formulation is intended to be analogous to how fork works in UNIX. It gives you
great power, and with it comes great responsibility.

Still very early days, but basic interface setup and container launch do work
with aufs and/or chroot.
